Android DayToDay
================

An Android date math app that allows you to easily:
* Add and subtract days from a date
* Determine number of days, weeks, and months between dates
* Determine time between dates in natural language

Overview
--------

This project began as a request from my wife to help the nurses at her practice.
They were counting out dates for shots, follow up appointments, etc on the
calendar. She asked me to make an app that would do it for them. I agreed and
created the app using [ActionBarSherlock] so it would be available across the
widest range of devices. It has now been converted to [ActionBarCompat] since
ActionBarSherlock is no longer supported.
